Here is a list of libraries that are based on Spire, or have Spire compatibility.

- [Libra](https://to-ithaca.github.io/libra/), dimensional analysis for Scala
- [coulomb](https://github.com/erikerlandson/coulomb) coulomb: unit analysis for Scala
- [circe-spire](https://github.com/circe/circe-spire) circe encoders and decoders for Spire types
- [onnx-scala](https://github.com/EmergentOrder/onnx-scala) An ONNX (Open Neural Network eXchange) API and backend for typeful, functional deep learning in Scala (3)
- [NDScala](https://github.com/SciScala/NDScala) N-dimensional arrays in Scala 3. Think NumPy ndarray, but with compile-time type-checking/inference over shapes, ndarray/axis labels & numeric data types
- [Sonic reducer](https://github.com/rklaehn/sonicreducer), Hierarchical reducer for arbitrary Scala sequences
- [spire-matrix](https://github.com/lJoublanc/spire-matrix), BLAS-backed implementation of `VectorSpace`. See #675. POC/Not for prod use.
